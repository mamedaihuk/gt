The xml files are perhaps binary versions of scripts for the game's own
scripting lang.

arm9.bin may contain an interpreter/parser for these scripts

## balloon_font_en.imb
Set hexeditor width to 24
---------------------------------
hexedit -l24 balloon_font_en.imb`
---------------------------------
...and you can actually see the characters.

Colour can also be controlled.
I assume there's more formatting options.

expression marks aren't in the balloon_font_en.imb
It's safe to say to say that there\'s more to the balloon font/text in the game
besides just balloon_font_en.imb

00 begins characters and 03 terms characters

seem to use mostly 3s and whatever else
