arm9.bin may contain an interpreter/parser for these scripts


# IMB
balloon_font_en.imb 	; balloon text font

some of the font files aren't even needed unclear where data is kept

fonts2bpp.bin stores font data.

CharWidth.bin controls character width.
F1** lines seem to controls space between puncuation.
First section seems to control space between first and second char.
Putting ff in every byte crowds text.
Putting 00 in every byte expands text -- which is the default.

Unsure how or if menu text can be modified.
