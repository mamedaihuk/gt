The strings _L$\d\d\d\d are possibly loading data. What is likely is that those lines in the asm are invalid because some type of data -- stuff other than instructions are stored. Though it could just be what's represented for strings.
"dword" is a term that seems to be popular in the lines that mention the stages. Not sure if it was this file or another one that uses the given file to go to stages.
"chapter.xml" could be meant for how you can choose chapters after you've completed them.

Everything after route.xml is invalid It seems to be just random data, but it's too difficult to tell.


Decompressing xml.lz Files with nlzss
=====================================

If you would like to run this command for all files in the current
directory, use this:

    $ for file in *.xml.lz; do nlzss "$file" > "${file%.*}"; done

For ZSH:

    % for file in *.xml.lz; do nlzss "$file" > "${file:r}"; done

Though if you would like to do this for all the files (including those
in subdirectories), run this command:

    $ for d in ./*/; do (for file in *.xml.lz; do nlzss "$file" > "${file%.*}"; done); done\

For ZSH:

    % for d in ./*/; do (for file in *.xml.lz; do nlzss "$file" > "${file:r}"; done); done
